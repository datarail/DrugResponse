## Deep Dye Drop based cell cycle gating

### Installation via conda/mamba
If necessary, install mamba:
```
conda install mamba
```

Create a conda environment with the necessary dependencies:
```
mamba env create -n deep_dye_drop --file=env_conda.yaml
```
Activate the new conda environment
```
conda activate deep_dye_drop
```

Install the cell_cycle_gating package and other necessary packages through pip
```
pip install git+https://github.com/datarail/datarail.git
pip install git+https://github.com/datarail/gr_metrics.git#egg=gr50\&subdirectory=SRC/python
pip install git+https://github.com/datarail/DrugResponse.git#egg=cell_cycle_gating\&subdirectory=python
```

Open Jupyter Lab:
```
jupyter-lab
```

If Jupyter Lab doesn't automatically open in your browser, visit http://localhost:8888/

Select the "deep-dye-drop" conda environment for the Python kernel.

### Installation via docker

Pull the docker image
```
docker pull labsyspharm/deep-dye-drop
```

Change to the directory you would like to mount via docker
```
cd <your directory>
```

Create a docker container running on port 7777 (you may choose any free port)
```
docker run -d -p 7777:8888 -v "${PWD}":/home/jovyan/work --name ddd_notebook labsyspharm/deep-dye-drop start-notebook.sh --IdentityProvider.token=''
```
 This will mount the current working directory to the "work" folder within the container, giving you access to the files and jupyter notebooks therein.

 Note: "jovyan" is the default username used by the [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) docker images upon which our docker image is built.

 Open Jupyter Lab in your browser at http://localhost:7777/ or on the port of your choosing.

 Select the "deep-dye-drop" conda environment for the Python kernel.

### Cell cycle gating example

See the "python/cell_cycle_gating/examples/DDR_example.ipynb" notebook.

### Getting started

* cd into the directory that contains the object level data folders. 
* Start a Jupyter notebook or Ipython session.
* For each plate (object level folder), use the template below to compute live/dead status and cell cycle phases of individual cells.
* The dataframe `df` returns well-level summary of number of live/dead cells and fraction of cells in each phase of the cell cycle.
* The script saves a pdf showing the gating on each DNA v EDU scatter plot for review. 
* The dataframe `df` is also saved as a .csv file with the same name as the object level folder.
  ```python 
  from cell_cycle_gating import run_cell_cycle_gating as rccg
  obj = 'path_to_object_level_data_folder'
  df = rccg.run(obj)
  ```
